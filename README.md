-[Introducing HTTP Interceptors](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/lecture/44116366)
  httpClient has methods which allow you to register a so-called Interceptor.
  Register an Interceptor at the place you provide the HTTP CLIent : here in the Bootstrap app (Main.ts).
  ```js
    bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
      providers:[provideHttpClient(
        withInterceptors([])
      )]
    }).catch((err) => console.error(err));
  ```
  in the array, pass functions.
